# it-is-the-first
just another repository it is but the first of me.

I will be adding my codes that i had written used in some projects that i had built over of the course of an year to GitHub now.
I mainly work on ML and some DL projects and the language i use to create such models is PYTHON.
As i am a spiritual being having this human experience, I connect more to code than anything else right now. 
I am very excited for you to check out my Git profile!
